# My Front-End Learning Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains a **personal learning project** where I designed and built a **responsive portfolio webpage** using **HTML and CSS**.  
The project helped me practice building clean, structured, and modern web pages while experimenting with layout, typography, colors, and interactivity.

This portfolio page showcases:
- An **intro section** with a personal bio.
- An **About Me** section detailing my journey and interests in web development.
- A **Projects table** highlighting my completed mini-projects.
- A **Contact section** with clickable links and an embedded map.

---

## Features
- Fully responsive layout using CSS variables and Flexbox.
- Styled navigation bar with hover effects.
- Consistent color scheme using primary and secondary colors.
- Interactive project table with hover effects on rows.
- Contact section with clickable links and embedded Google Maps.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations for enhanced user experience.

---

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, I focused on:
- Semantic HTML structure (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`, `table`).
- CSS variables for consistent theming and maintainable styling.
- Flexbox for layout and alignment of navigation and contact sections.
- Styling tables with hover effects and responsive design.
- Integrating external resources such as Font Awesome icons and Google Maps.
- Practicing responsive design principles for desktop and mobile screens.

## Future Enhancements
Some ideas I plan to explore next:
- Add **JavaScript interactivity** for smooth scrolling or project filtering.
- Implement **dark/light mode toggle**.
- Convert the project into a **multi-page portfolio**.
- Include **animations** for page sections on scroll.
- Integrate a **contact form** with backend handling.
- Make the project fully **mobile-first** with advanced responsiveness.
