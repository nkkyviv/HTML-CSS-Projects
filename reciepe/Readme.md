# Delicious Pancakes Recipe Page

## Overview
This project is a simple and fun front-end learning exercise where I built a **recipe webpage** using only **HTML and CSS**.  
It features a “Delicious Pancakes” recipe presented in a clean, responsive layout with a smooth image hover effect, ingredient list, and step-by-step instructions.  

The purpose of this mini-project was to strengthen my understanding of:
- Writing semantic and well-structured HTML  
- Styling with CSS (colors, spacing, hover effects, shadows)  
- Designing a visually appealing layout using basic front-end principles  

---

## Features
- Simple, readable layout with a header, main content, and footer  
- Pancake image with a smooth hover animation  
- Clear ingredient and instruction sections using HTML lists  
- Styled “More Recipe” button with hover feedback  
- Consistent color scheme using green tones  
- Beginner-friendly, fully static webpage

## What I Learned
Through this project, I practiced:
- Using semantic HTML elements (`header`, `main`, `footer`, `ul`, `ol`)  
- Organizing a web page for readability and structure  
- Applying CSS transitions and hover effects  
- Centering and styling content for a clean visual balance  
- Building a complete, self-contained static webpage

## Future Enhancements
Here are a few ideas I plan to explore in the future:
- Add **JavaScript interactivity**, such as a “Show More Recipes” feature  
- Implement a **dark/light mode toggle** for accessibility  
- Add a **form** for users to submit their own recipes  
- Use **CSS Grid or Flexbox** to improve responsiveness on mobile devices  
- Include a **“Print Recipe”** or **“Download as PDF”** option  
- Fetch recipes dynamically from a **recipe API** or local JSON file
