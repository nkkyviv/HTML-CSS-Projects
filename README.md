# Front-End Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of my **HTML and CSS projects** as I learn front-end web development.  

The purpose of this repository is to **track my learning progress**, experiment with web design, and practice creating **clean, responsive, and visually appealing web pages**. Each folder contains a project that demonstrates different aspects of front-end development, including:

- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid)
- Styling with colors, fonts, and variables
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Interactive elements like buttons, hover effects, and transitions

This repository serves as a **personal learning portfolio** where I can save and showcase my work as I continue to build my skills in web development. Over time, I plan to enhance these projects by adding JavaScript functionality, improving responsiveness, and experimenting with modern front-end frameworks.
