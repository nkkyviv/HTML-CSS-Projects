# Join Our Agency – Form Design Project

## Overview
This project is a **modern web form** built using **HTML and CSS** as part of my front-end development learning journey.  
The goal of this exercise was to design a **clean, user-friendly, and visually appealing form layout** that demonstrates my understanding of form structure, styling, and user experience design.

The form allows users to provide details about their projects and includes multiple input types such as text fields, email, password, radio buttons, checkboxes, date picker, dropdowns, and a textarea.

## Features
- Fully responsive and centered form layout.  
- Styled using CSS **variables**, **fieldsets**, and **custom hover/focus states**.  
- Real-time feedback with:
  - 🔴 **Red border** for empty focused fields.  
  - 🟢 **Green border** for valid inputs.  
  - 🔵 **Blue glow** for active input focus.  
- Includes diverse input elements:
  - Text, email, password, phone number  
  - Radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menu  
  - Date picker and text area  
- Uses **CSS transitions** for smooth hover and focus effects.  
- Simple and intuitive **button animation** on hover and click.

## Learning Objectives
This project helped me practice and understand:
- Structuring forms with semantic HTML (`form`, `fieldset`, `legend`, `label`, etc.)  
- Designing accessible and consistent input elements.  
- Implementing interactive states using CSS pseudo-classes (`:focus`, `:valid`, `:placeholder-shown`).  
- Using CSS variables for **color theming** and reusability.  
- Creating a layout with **consistent spacing and shadow effects**.

## Future Enhancements
Ideas for future improvements include:
- Adding **JavaScript validation** for dynamic user feedback.  
- Creating **form submission confirmation modals**.  
- Making the form mobile-optimized using **media queries**.  
- Connecting the form to a **backend service** or **email handler**.  
- Enhancing accessibility with **ARIA labels** and better keyboard navigation.
